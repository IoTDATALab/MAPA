# MAPA
This project contains two settings. One is about simulations using PySyft framework, wherein we used six benchmark datasets (Synthetic; FEMNIST, CelebA; Sent140, Shakespeare, Reddit) provided by LEAF. The other is about experiments using dockers to communicate with the Ali server, wherein we used two datasets (FEMNIST and Reddit) for simplicity.
The Asyn and flat in file names present using asynchronous update and using the flatting clip in the algorithms.
